        "Time series forecasting occurs when you make scientific predictions based on historical time stamped data. It involves building models through historical analysis and using them to make observations and drive future strategic decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "Predictions are made for new data when the actual outcome may not be known until some future date. The future is being predicted, but all prior observations are almost always treated equally.time series forecasting uses the information in a time series (perhaps with additional information) to forecast future values of that series.\n",
        "\n",
        "Making predictions about the future is called extrapolation in the classical statistical handling of time series data.More modern fields focus on the topic and refer to it as time series forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations.\n"
